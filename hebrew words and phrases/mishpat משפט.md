# mishpat משפט

Numbers 27:1-11

The daughters of Zelophehad come to Mosheh and ask that their father's inheritance pass to them as they have no brothers.

Mosheh brought the matter before Adonai, and Adonai commanded Mosheh a chukah (חוקה) of mishpat (משפט) that if a man has no son, his inheritance passes to his daughter.
