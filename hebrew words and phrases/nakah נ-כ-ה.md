*Bnei Yisrael complain to Par'oh that while they are no longer given straw (or building material) \[[[teven תבן]]\], they are still told to make bricks \[[[levenah לבנה]]\]. They claim the sin \[[[chatat חטאת]]\] is with the people of Par'oh.*
*Note that the sense of the final two words in this verse is difficult to translate. The word for sin could be the pa'al completed second person feminine singular of \[[[chata ח-ט-א]]\] (as the nikud shows), instead of a noun form.*
